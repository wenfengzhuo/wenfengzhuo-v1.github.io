Finding a job in US is never an easy task, especially technical jobs though there is a hug demand. I started my job searching in the early September last year, and stopped until I finished
my last onsite interview with Quantcast on Feb. 28 this year (2017). During this peroid, I had totally 14 technical phone interviews and I passed 11 of them (Some companies have multiple phone rounds, like Quantcast and SumoLogic).
I got 6 onsite interviews after I passed those phone interviews, and finally I received 4 offers from these companies: SumoLogic, Amazon, Uber and Quantcast.

Then I realized that signing an offer was even more complicated and strugling. To me, these four companies are great and very attractive. 

**SumoLogic**

SumoLogic is a healthy and growing startup based in Redwood City, CA. The company provides a cloud log management platform which altenates with the industry leader - Splunk. More and more customers adopt the ideas that collecting and analyzing
machine data in cluster is a more cost-efficient way. Despite a startup they claimed, actually they have now nearly 80+ engineers to solve complex and interesting problems. They maintain a large distributed system that process 100+PB data each day.
Now they have 1000+ customers and more to come.

**Amazon**

Amazon is alreay a well-known giant company. The public company now reaches the market cap at about 400B, which is nearly 50% more than Alibaba. They have three major products that dominates the online retailer market: Marketplace, Prime, and AWS. They
call these three products as three pillars in Amazon. My offer from Amazon was not extended by the teams of these three products but rather a inner "startup" team - Advertising Team. It is now a team with 800+ engineers and other people, which acts like a
fast growing startup in Amazon. I was very excited about this opportunity because I personally believe that advertising will be fourth pillar in Amazon. 

**Uber**

Uber is an aggressive company and never a startup any more despite that it was just founded at 2009. It is claimed that now Uber is at least worth 60B, which is a huge number that surpasses a lot of big companies. Uber comes from a disruptive idea that aims to
solve one of the most complex problem in the world - transportation. Thanks to this huge problem, Uber also grows exponentially along these years and expands now in 550+ cities worldwide. Uber is still continuing disrupting many industries with their existing platform.
UberEats is another product that now are widely spread in many cities. I personally believe that more and more disruptive products will be brought by Uber and constantly change and improve people's daily life.

**Quantcast**

Quantcast is a profitable company that is not known by lots of people. Being in Ad Tech industry is not a good choice because there are so many companies that compete for pieces of the big "cake" - Online Advertising. Quantcast is not just performing and running very well 
in this industry, but also is one of the few companies who have gained net profit for many years. One of facts could prove their ability to make profit is that their last fund was 2011, 6 years from now. The company provides a powerful free product called Quantcast Measure that is adopted 
by most of Top 100 websites worldwide, and millions of websites are using the product. This generous product gives them back a huge amount of data that helps Quantcast has precise understanding of users. This understanding further enables Quantcast to perform a lot better than 
other competitors in prospecting and retargeting.
